        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          The Device APIs Working Group aims at producing Web client-side APIs that 
          facilitate deeper integration of Web applications into advanced capabilities 
          of their host devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          These capabilities include access to a camera, microphone, address book, 
          calendar, or system information such as network connection and battery level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding these advanced features to the Web environment empowers Web developers 
          to create richer and more context-aware Web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given the sensitive nature of the data and sensors to which these APIs grant access, 
          the Working Group also aims at crafting APIs that are both secure and privacy-enabling 
          by design, based on the current Web browser security model. This entails reusing 
          existing browser-based security metaphors where they apply and looking into innovative 
          security and privacy mechanisms where they don’t.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class='scope' id='scope'>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          The scope of this Working Group is this creation of API specifications for a device’s 
          services that can be exposed to Web applications . Devices in this context include 
          desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile Internet devices (MIDs), cellular phones, 
          TVs, cameras, and other connected devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priority will be given to developing simple and consensual APIs, leaving more complex 
          features to future versions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group’s deliverables must address issues of <strong><em>accessibility</em></strong>,
          <strong><em>internationalization</em></strong>, <strong><em>mobility</em></strong>, 
          <strong><em>security</em></strong> and <strong><em>privacy</em></strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, comprehensive test suites will be developed for each specification to ensure 
          interoperability, and the group will create interoperability reports. The group will also 
          maintain errata as required for the continued relevance and usefulness of the specifications 
          it produces.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>
            To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is expected to have two independent 
            implementations of all features defined in the specification, including implementation on a 
            constrained device (e.g. mobile phone, TV, camera).
          </p>
          <p>
            APIs that cannot be demonstrated to be implementable securely within the default browser context 
            will not be released. This does not preclude these APIs to support use cases of installable Web 
            applications.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Out of Scope</h3>
          <p>
            The definition of a policy framework that would allow using the defined APIs into a different 
            security environment than the default browser context is out of the scope for this group.
          </p>

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <section id='rec-track'>
          <h3>Recommendation-Track Deliverables</h3>
          <p>
            The working group will deliver the following specifications:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Calendar API, an API to access a calendar service (e.g. to add an entry, to edit an entry, 
              to delete an entry).
            </li>
            <li>
              Tasks API, an API to access a personal task management / organizer service (e.g. to add, 
              edit, delete a task).
            </li>
            <li id='contacts'>
              Contacts API, an API to access a contacts or address book service (e.g. to add an entry, 
              to edit an entry, to delete an entry).
            </li>
            <li id='camera'>
              Capture API, an API to manage a device’s camera and microphone, e.g. to take a picture 
              or record a sound. This work will be carried out in conjunction with the WebRTC WG.
            </li>
            <li id='messaging'>
              Messaging API, an API to create and send a message. The API may be agnostic to the underlying 
              messaging service (e.g. e-mail, SMS, MMS).
            </li>
            <li id='network'>An API to discover the current network characteristics.</li>
            <li id='battery'>An API to react to a device power status.</li>
            <li id='sysinfo'>An API to retrieve data generically from sensors.</li>
            <li id='applauncher'>
              An API that allows Web applications to register themselves as handlers/providers based on 
              identifiers and an API that enables other Web applications to discover these handlers/providers 
              and gain permission to interact with them. This is commonly known as Web Intents, though the
              final specification may carry a different name. This work will be carried out in conjunction 
              with the Web Apps WG.
            </li>
            <li id='gallery'>
              Gallery API, an API to access the user's media gallery services (e.g. pictures, music play lists).
            </li>
            <li id='ui'>An API to manage vibration.</li>
            <li id='menus'>An API to manage application menus.</li>
            <li id='discovery'>
              An API to discover and communicate with devices and services on the same device, on the local 
              network, or directly connected, e.g. by USB and Bluetooth (<a href='#nb'>*</a>).
            </li>
            <li id='bt'>An API to interact with services available over Bluetooth.</li>
            <li id='qr'>An API to process QR codes extracting them from stills or streams and returning their content.</li>
            <li id='appstore'>
              An API to install Web apps and to manage a client-side collection of Web apps that a user has installed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            (<span id='nb'>*</span>)<strong>Note</strong>: the Web and TV Interest Group and the Multimodal 
            Interaction  Working Group are also working on topics related to discovery APIs. The Device APIs 
            Working Group will liaise with them on these topics. As the discussion evolves, the groups will 
            investigate the opportunity of creating a separate Working Group dedicated to local device discovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where practical, the API specifications should use the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/'>Web IDL</a> 
            formalism.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Working Group may also enter into joint Task Forces with other groups (in particular with the 
            Web Applications and WebRTC Working Groups), to collaborate on specifications that cross group boundaries.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Other Deliverables</h3>
          <p>
            A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is necessary to ensure the 
            specification’s robustness, consistency, and implementability, and to promote interoperability 
            between User Agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test suite, which 
            should be completed by the end of the Last Call phase, and must be completed, with an 
            implementation report, before transition from Candidate Recommendation to Proposed Recommendation. 
            Additional tests may be added to the test suite at any stage of the Recommendation track, and the 
            maintenance of a implementation report is encouraged.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Working Group may also document in a Working Group Note the useful design patterns shared by 
            the APIs it is developing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Working Group is also planning to work on Best Practices for Privacy-sensitive Web applications, 
            as well as documenting Privacy Use Cases and Requirements in Working Group Notes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other non-normative documents may be created such as:
          </p>
          <ul id='ig-other-deliverables'>
            <li>Primers</li>
            <li>Requirements and use case document for specifications</li>
            <li>Non-normative group notes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Given sufficient resources, this Working Group should review other working groups’ deliverables that 
            are identified as being relevant to the Working Group’s mission.

          <h3>Milestones</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the behaviour of numbers. 
              Just as Albert Einstein's general relativity theory observed that space was not an absolute but 
              depended on the observer's movement in time, and that time was not an absolute, but depended on 
              the observer's movement in space, so it is now realized that numbers are not absolute, but depend 
              on the observer's movement in restaurants.
            </p>
            <p>
              (...)
            </p>
            <p>
              The first nonabsolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved. This will vary 
              during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent 
              relation to the number of people who actually turn up, or the number of people who subsequently join 
              them after the show/match/party/gig, or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has 
              shown up.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second nonabsolute number is the given time of arrival, which is now known to be one of those 
              most bizarre mathematical concepts, a recipriversexcluson, a number whose existence can only be 
              defined as being anything other than itself. In other words, the given time of arrival is the one 
              moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive. 
              Recipriversexclusons now play a vital part in many branches of mathematics, including statistics and 
              accountancy, and also form the basic equations used to engineer the Somebody Else's Problem field.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third and most mysterious piece of nonabsoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the 
              number of items on the bill, the cost of each item, the number of people at the table and what they
              are each prepared to pay for. (The number of people who have actually brought any money is only a 
              sub-phenomenon in this field.)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            It is a known and well-accepted fact of W3C Working Group life that the dates specified in the Milestones
            section of a group's charter are recipriversexclusons. The date at which the Working Group will ship that
            specification at the indicated level of maturity can be before or after the indicated date, or the group
            may have abandoned the deliverable, but it can never be within the indicated time frame.
          </p>
          <p>
            The maths involved in producing correct recipriversexclusons being complex and resource intensive, the
            charter's author has decided to simply do without.

        <section>
          <h3>W3C Groups</h3>
          <p>
            This Working Group’s specifications depend upon some specifications being developed by other 
            Working Groups for example the Web Applications Working Group’s Web IDL specification and
            several of the Device APIs Working Group's specifications.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Working Group is not aware of any dependencies other Working Groups’ specifications have on 
            this Working Group’s specifications.

          <h3>Liaisons</h3>
          <p>
            This Working Group expects to maintain contacts with at least the following groups and Activities 
            within W3C (in alphabetical order):
          </p>

            <dd>
              The Device APIs Group is chartered to develop APIs that are closely related to several of those
              in this group's deliverables, but that function inside the browser security model. Such APIs should
              be closely coordinated as they are likely to feature common aspects.
            </dd>
            <dt><a id='html' href='http://www.w3.org/html/wg/'>HTML Working Group</a></dt>
            <dd>
              The HTML Working Group’s deliverables cover the security model implemented in Web Browsers; this

          <p>
            The following is a tentative list of external bodies the Working Group should collaborate with:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><a href='http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm' id='tc39'>Ecma International Technical Committee 39 (TC39)</a></dt>
            <dd>
              This is the group responsible for EcmaScript standardization, and related EcmaScript features like E4X. As this
              Working Group is developing EcmaScript APIs, it should collaborate with TC39.

      <section class='participation' id='participation'>
        <h2>Participation</h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 10 or more active participants for its duration, and 
          to have the participation of the industry leaders in fields relevant to the specifications it produces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chairs and specification Editors are expected to contribute one to two days per week towards the Working 
          Group. There is no minimum requirement for other participants. However, it should be noted that as defined by 
          the <a href='http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups.html#good-standing'>Process Document</a>, group 
          participants need to attend most meetings, be familiar with documents and minutes of past meeting, and follow 
          the relevant mailing lists to be considered in good standing; this is likely to require at least half a day a 
          week.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each specification the Working Group will name a Test Facilitator whose responsibility is to ensure that a 
          Test Suite is made available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the input from the group participants, the Chairs may also decide to create task forces that allow

          This Working Group welcomes participation from non-Members. The group encourages questions and comments on its 
          public mailing list, <a href='mailto:public-system-apis@w3.org'>public-system-apis@w3.org</a>, which is
          <a href='http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-system-apis/'>publicly archived</a> and for which there is 
          no formal requirement for participation. The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions 
          for consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under 
          the W3C Patent Policy.

        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>
          Most of the technical work of the group is done through discussions on the 
          <a href='http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-system-apis/'>public-system-apis@w3.org</a>,
          the group’s public mailing list. Editors’ drafts and their editing history is available from a public W3C Web 
          site. The group’s <i>action</i> and <i>issue</i> tracking data is also public, as are the participants-approved
          <i>minutes</i> from all teleconferences and meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general the Working Group does not hold teleconferences, but a teleconference can be scheduled occasionally
          at the chairs' discretion if a specific topic seems to warrant synchronous discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group uses a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs 
          and participants of the group, for Member-only discussions in special cases when a particular participant requests such
          a discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (for example, details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants) is
          available from the <a href='http://www.w3.org/groups/system-apis/'>System Level APIs Working Group home page.</a>

        <h2>Decision Policy</h2>
        <p>
          As explained in the Process Document (<a href='/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus'>section 3.3</a>), 
          this group seeks to make decisions when there is consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes
          dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should record a decision (possibly 
          after a formal vote) and any objections, and move on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asynchronous decisions that are attained through the mailing list, possibly using a “Call for Consensus”
          process are preferred, but synchronous decisions made during a teleconference or a face-to-face meeting
          are valid provided that the topic they address was clearly outlined in a public agenda posted one week
          earlier so that non-participating parties have a chance to voice their views ahead of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with <a href='http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes'>Section 3.4,
          Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
