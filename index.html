          The mission of the <a href='http://www.w3.org/groups/system-apis/'>System Level APIs Working Group</a> is
          to create a broad set of APIs that enable the development of applications that make use of features
          typically provided by an operating system. These APIs are distinct from those produced by the 
          <a href='http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/'>Device APIs Working Group</a> in that they are not expected
          to be safe to run in a browser environment, and therefore do not need to adhere to the browser
          security model.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          The System Level APIs Working Group aims to produce APIs that integrate closely with the
          operating system's functionality, thereby enabling an entire applicative ecosystem to be
          written using nothing but the Web platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating the ability to produce applications relying primarily on the Web platform, even if
          outside the browser's security model, extends the reach of the Web to new places and opens
          the door to greater cooperation between the Web and the operating system.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section class='scope' id='scope'>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          The scope of this Working Group is this creation of API specifications for a device’s 
          services and capabilities that can not be exposed safely to Web applications. Devices 
          in this context include desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile Internet devices 
          (MIDs), cellular phones, TVs, cameras, and other connected devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priority will be given to developing simple and consensual APIs, leaving more complex 
          features to future versions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group’s deliverables must address issues of <strong><em>accessibility</em></strong>,
          <strong><em>internationalization</em></strong>, <strong><em>mobility</em></strong>, 
          <strong><em>security</em></strong> and <strong><em>privacy</em></strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, comprehensive test suites will be developed for each specification to ensure 
          interoperability, and the group will create interoperability reports. The group will also 
          maintain errata as required for the continued relevance and usefulness of the specifications 
          it produces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this group does not presume of the exact context in which these APIs will be used,
          beyond the fact that they will not be available in security-sensitive settings such as arbitrary
          Web content. It may be possible to make use of this functionality in traditional applications,
          just as well as it may be exposed for instance to browser extensions.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>
            To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is expected to have two independent 
            implementations of all features defined in the specification, including implementation on a 
            constrained device (e.g. mobile phone, TV, camera).
          </p>
          <p>
            APIs that are demonstrated to be implementable with the default browser security context
            should not be released by this group; it is recommended instead that they be transferred
            to the Web Applications or Device APIs Working Groups.

          <p>
            Note that where applicable, the group is free to split the above deliverables into several smaller specifications
            that collectively address the same space, or conversely to join some of the above into a single specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where practical, the API specifications should use the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/'>Web IDL</a> 
            formalism.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Working Group may also enter into joint Task Forces with other groups (in particular with the 
            Device APIs Working Group), to collaborate on the deliverables above if specifications cross group 
            boundaries.

          <h3>Other Deliverables</h3>
          <p>
            A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is necessary to ensure the 
            specification’s robustness, consistency, and implementability, and to promote interoperability 
            between User Agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test suite, which 
            should be completed by the end of the Last Call phase, and must be completed, with an 
            implementation report, before transition from Candidate Recommendation to Proposed Recommendation. 
            Additional tests may be added to the test suite at any stage of the Recommendation track, and the 
            maintenance of a implementation report is encouraged.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Working Group may also document in a Working Group Note the useful design patterns shared by 
            the APIs it is developing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Working Group is also planning to work on Best Practices for Privacy-sensitive Web applications, 
            as well as documenting Privacy Use Cases and Requirements in Working Group Notes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other non-normative documents may be created such as:
          </p>
          <ul id='ig-other-deliverables'>
            <li>Primers</li>
            <li>Requirements and use case document for specifications</li>
            <li>Non-normative group notes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Given sufficient resources, this Working Group should review other working groups’ deliverables that 
            are identified as being relevant to the Working Group’s mission.

          <h3>Milestones</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the behaviour of numbers. 
              Just as Albert Einstein's general relativity theory observed that space was not an absolute but 
              depended on the observer's movement in time, and that time was not an absolute, but depended on 
              the observer's movement in space, so it is now realized that numbers are not absolute, but depend 
              on the observer's movement in restaurants.
            </p>
            <p>
              (...)
            </p>
            <p>
              The first nonabsolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved. This will vary 
              during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent 
              relation to the number of people who actually turn up, or the number of people who subsequently join 
              them after the show/match/party/gig, or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has 
              shown up.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second nonabsolute number is the given time of arrival, which is now known to be one of those 
              most bizarre mathematical concepts, a recipriversexcluson, a number whose existence can only be 
              defined as being anything other than itself. In other words, the given time of arrival is the one 
              moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive. 
              Recipriversexclusons now play a vital part in many branches of mathematics, including statistics and 
              accountancy, and also form the basic equations used to engineer the Somebody Else's Problem field.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third and most mysterious piece of nonabsoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the 
              number of items on the bill, the cost of each item, the number of people at the table and what they
              are each prepared to pay for. (The number of people who have actually brought any money is only a 
              sub-phenomenon in this field.)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            It is a known and well-accepted fact of W3C Working Group life that the dates specified in the Milestones
            section of a group's charter are recipriversexclusons. The date at which the Working Group will ship that
            specification at the indicated level of maturity can be before or after the indicated date, or the group
            may have abandoned the deliverable, but it can never be within the indicated time frame.
          </p>
          <p>
            The maths involved in producing correct recipriversexclusons being complex and resource intensive, the
            charter's author has decided to simply do without.

          <p>
            This Working Group expects to maintain contacts with at least the following groups and Activities 
            within W3C (in alphabetical order):
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><a href='http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/'>Device APIs Working Group</a></dt>
            <dd>
              The Device APIs Group is chartered to develop APIs that are closely related to several of those
              in this group's deliverables, but that function inside the browser security model. Such APIs should
              be closely coordinated as they are likely to feature common aspects.
            </dd>
            <dt><a href='http://www.w3.org/html/wg/'>HTML Working Group</a></dt>
            <dd>
              The HTML Working Group’s deliverables cover the security model implemented in Web Browsers; this 
              security model imposes limitations on what an extended model for Web Applications can achieve.
            </dd>
            <dt><a href='http://www.w3.org/WAI/'>Web Accessibility Initiative</a>
                <a href='http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/'>Protocols and Formats Working Group</a></dt>
            <dd>
              To ensure this Working Group’s deliverables support accessibility requirements, particularly with 
              regard to interoperability with assistive technologies, and inclusion in deliverables of guidance 
              for implementing the group’s deliverables in ways that support accessibility requirements.
            </dd>
            <dt><a href='http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/'>Web Applications Working Group</a></dt>
            <dd>
              This group defines relevant specifications including <cite><a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/'>Web IDL</a></cite>, 
              and <cite><a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/'>File API</a></cite>.
            </dd>
            <dt><a href='http://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/'>Web Application Security Working Group</a></dt>
            <dd>
              Since the Web security model is a core concern here, interactions with this group are strongly
              encouraged.
            </dd>

          <h3>External Groups</h3>
          <p>
            The following is a tentative list of external bodies the Working Group should collaborate with:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><a href='http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm' id='tc39'>Ecma International Technical Committee 39 (TC39)</a></dt>
            <dd>
              This is the group responsible for EcmaScript standardization, and related EcmaScript features like E4X. As this
              Working Group is developing EcmaScript APIs, it should collaborate with TC39.
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section class='participation' id='participation'>
        <h2>Participation</h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 10 or more active participants for its duration, and 
          to have the participation of the industry leaders in fields relevant to the specifications it produces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chairs and specification Editors are expected to contribute one to two days per week towards the Working 
          Group. There is no minimum requirement for other participants. However, it should be noted that as defined by 
          the <a href='http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups.html#good-standing'>Process Document</a>, group 
          participants need to attend most meetings, be familiar with documents and minutes of past meeting, and follow 
          the relevant mailing lists to be considered in good standing; this is likely to require at least half a day a 
          week.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each specification the Working Group will name a Test Facilitator whose responsibility is to ensure that a 
          Test Suite is made available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the input from the group participants, the Chairs may also decide to create task forces that allow 
          more focused discussions for topics that require specific expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group welcomes participation from non-Members. The group encourages questions and comments on its 
          public mailing list, <a href='mailto:public-system-apis@w3.org'>public-system-apis@w3.org</a>, which is
          <a href='http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-system-apis/'>publicly archived</a> and for which there is 
          no formal requirement for participation. The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions 
          for consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under 
          the W3C Patent Policy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class='communication' id='communication'>
        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>
          Most of the technical work of the group is done through discussions on the 
          <a href='http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-system-apis/'>public-system-apis@w3.org</a>,
          the group’s public mailing list. Editors’ drafts and their editing history is available from a public W3C Web 
          site. The group’s <i>action</i> and <i>issue</i> tracking data is also public, as are the participants-approved
          <i>minutes</i> from all teleconferences and meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general the Working Group does not hold teleconferences, but a teleconference can be scheduled occasionally
          at the chairs' discretion if a specific topic seems to warrant synchronous discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group uses a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs 
          and participants of the group, for Member-only discussions in special cases when a particular participant requests such
          a discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (for example, details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants) is
          available from the <a href='http://www.w3.org/groups/system-apis/'>System Level APIs Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>

      <section class='decisions' id='decisions'>
        <h2>Decision Policy</h2>
        <p>
          As explained in the Process Document (<a href='/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus'>section 3.3</a>), 
          this group seeks to make decisions when there is consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes
          dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should record a decision (possibly 
          after a formal vote) and any objections, and move on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asynchronous decisions that are attained through the mailing list, possibly using a “Call for Consensus”
          process are preferred, but synchronous decisions made during a teleconference or a face-to-face meeting
          are valid provided that the topic they address was clearly outlined in a public agenda posted one week
          earlier so that non-participating parties have a chance to voice their views ahead of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with <a href='http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes'>Section 3.4,
          Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
        </p>
